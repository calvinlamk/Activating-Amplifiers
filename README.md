# Activating-Amplifiers

This github contains sample codes for the following manuscript: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.15.532861v2
This code runs on CompuCell3D v3.7.8 which can be found at the organization's website, along with instructions. 
Instructions can also be found at the page for the original model: https://github.com/lmorsut/Lam_Morsut_GJSM

The repository here contains example codes for the above manuscript. 

I have included the file: NP_TempPerma which is the code for the Ncad Pcad structure with temporarily amplified gray cells (Ncad) and permanently amplified orange cells (Pcad). This corresponds to figure 5C of the manuscript.
Parameters can be changed to model the other tested structures in this study by following the changes made in the Supplementary Table in the biorxiv link.
For example, to obtain the E-cadherin based structures change the adhesion to the E-cadherin parameters and the circuit equations as desired.

I have also included the code for the synthetic immunotherapy study with the heterogenous tumor. The file is SbTempAmpHML_PS and corresponds to Supplementary figure 7. All the other experiments can be derived from the code by changing the tested parameter.

The full codes will be published upon publication of the manuscript. Please don't hesitate to contact me for questions or help.
